# Face Detection with OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project implements a simple real-time face detection system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The code captures video from the webcam, detects faces in real-time, and displays bounding boxes around the detected faces with confidence scores.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

# How to Run

- Ensure you have a webcam connected to your system.
- Install the required libraries.
- Press 'q' to quit the application.
- Run the Python script:

```bash
python face_detection.py

Press 'q' to quit the application.
